# Speed up Your Coding
## Code Quickly with Constructs 
This repo aims at keeping a list of constructs of DSA which you can memorize to code efficiently and avoid the errors.\
Just like we have **(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab** we never derive the formula in our exams and always use the result to speed-up our work.\
On Similar lines, this repo will have constructs which you can memorize and speed up your coding.\
Here I am keeping all that what I am using multiple times and feel it's better to keep it in memory\n

## Have Library Function Handy
There are tons of Library functions we use, and tend to forget the ones which we don't use too often. Then we have to write code for it while coding. 
This repo aims at keeping library fuctions which can help us speed up our coding.
